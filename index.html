            I appreciate how your goals are not just about personal success but
            also about making a positive impact on others and the world around
            you.

      <h2>HOW DO I SEE MYSELF 5 YEARS FROM NOW?</h2>
      <div class="me-in-five-years-box">
        <p>
          5 years from now, I see myself having a job where I can say that all
          of my hardships in college were worth it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I can see myself capable of helping and giving back to my parents and
          to the people who helped me to get through my college. In this time, I
          can also provide enough food for myself, my siblings and my pets.
        </p>

        <p>
          In terms of work: I can see myself learning new things, adapting to
          ever evolving technology and contributing to a good and healthy
          environment around me. I am a good programmer and designer, 5 years
          from now.
        </p>
        <p>
          These past few months have been really hard and stressful not only
          because of the academics but also because of my personal problems in
          life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Academics have been hard for me because I don't have my own laptop, I
          was only borrowing it. There are times that I can't go to school
          because of financial problems and there are also times wherein I would
          find a place to stay for the night because my father does not want me
          to be in the house.
        </p>
        <p>
          College was hard and my personal problems are making it harder. But I
          have a dream, I have a goal that I badly want to achieve. I want to
          have a house that I can call "home" and this education, this
          university and this course would serve as a bridge towards reaching my
          goals. Therefore, yes it is worth and I still want to be here, no
          matter how hard it would become.
